# Rag-System-In-Python
This repository is dedicated for RAG system in python using google colab

### Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in Python, demonstrated through the RAG_BOT.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The project showcases how to combine document retrieval with text generation to create context-aware responses.

### Key Features
  - Document retrieval from a knowledge base
  - Context analysis and integration
  - Response generation using generative AI
  - End-to-end pipeline implementation in Python

### Technologies Used
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Libraries:
      - langchain (for RAG pipeline)
      - FAISS (vector database)
      - google gemini model (generative model integration)
      - tiktoken (token management)

### Setup & Installation
1. Download only RAG_BOT.ipynb file
2. Upload it in your own google colab environment.
3. Upload your pdf file and change the path and filename in pdf_file path.
4. Run all code blocks.
